# React + Redux + API

This project is working out how to get Redux to use middleware to call an API.

React, no problem.  Redux, well kinda complicated.  Add an API?  Good luck.

Inspired by the reduxjs tutorial and the article by Soham Kamani (http://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/06/05/redux-apis/)
